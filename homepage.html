        <h2>Guidelines for Creating an Effective Timetable</h2>
        <ol>
    
<li>Theory part of courses oAered are dropped in various slots named A1 to G2 and lab components are dropped into 
lab slots named L1 to L40. Hence, a single slot may carry multiple courses. A single course may be offered in 
multiple slots. 

<li>Students can decide what courses they want to register and study and select the slots accordingly. In case a same 
course dropped into a single slot is taught by multiple faculties in various classrooms, students can select one of 
the venue/ faculty from the same slot. 

<li>Students needing help in course registration will be provided by their Mentor or at Help desk (2nd floor room no. 
218 Computer lab). 

<li>Students need to choose their courses and slots in priori with a pre-filled slot timetable. At times, you may need to make a 
different choice (in course/ slot/ venue/ faculty) to register into a specific course that you have selected.</li>
 
<li>Registration will be first-cum, first-served basis.No proxy is allowed.</li>
 
<li> In case the class is already full to the capacity, students can register that course by choosing a different slot/ 
venue.</li>

<li>In case of a Theory embedded Lab (TEL) course, the registration into the course is deemed complete only after 
both the theory and lab(s) are individually registered. If either the theory or lab component is not registered, then, 
the registration into that course is considered as incomplete. Tip: When you complete registration into the theory 
part of a course, complete the Lab registration immediately, before moving to the next course registration.</li>

<li> Re-registration of a failed course can be re-registered into, if the same course is offered now, and the student can 
register into it without any clash, then, registration confirmation is subject to paying re-registration fees.</li>

<li>Students are advised to register into courses recommended by their Program School and the credit range shall be 
a minimum of 16 credits and a maximum of 27 credits and is subject to the academic ability/ interest of an 
individual student.</li>

<li> Students may contact their Mentor or School Timetable Coordinator or HoD or HoI for details related to registering 
into Open Elective courses.</li>

<li>After you complete registration of all your courses (theory & labs), this will be your final timetable for this semester. </li>
