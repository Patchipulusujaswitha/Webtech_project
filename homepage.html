        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">To ensure a smooth and successful timetable registration process and to maximize your academic planning, please adhere to the following comprehensive guidelines:</p>
        <ol class="list-none p-0 m-0 mt-6 mb-8 counter-reset-list-item">
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Course & Lab Slotting:</strong> Theory components of courses are strategically distributed across various designated slots (e.g., <strong class="font-semibold">A1 to G2</strong>). Similarly, all practical/lab components are assigned to specific lab slots (e.g., <strong class="font-semibold">L1 to L40</strong>). It's important to note that a single slot may contain multiple course offerings, and conversely, a single course might be offered across multiple different slots to provide maximum choice.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Course Selection & Customization:</strong> You, as a student, possess the autonomy to decide precisely which courses you wish to register for. Once chosen, you can then select the corresponding slots that best fit your schedule. In scenarios where the same course within a single slot is delivered by multiple faculties in various classrooms, you are empowered to choose your preferred venue and faculty.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Dedicated Assistance for Registration:</strong> Should you require any guidance or encounter challenges during the course registration process, dedicated support will be readily provided by your assigned <strong class="font-semibold">Mentor</strong> or through our accessible <strong class="font-semibold">Help Desk</strong>, conveniently located on the <strong class="font-semibold">2nd floor, Room No. 218, Computer Lab</strong>.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Prioritization & Adaptability:</strong> It is crucial to meticulously plan your course selections and slot choices in conjunction with the pre-filled slot timetable. There may be instances where you need to exercise flexibility and make alternative choices (in course, slot, venue, or even faculty) to successfully register for a specific course you've prioritized.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">First-Come, First-Served Basis:</strong> All course registrations operate strictly on a <strong class="font-semibold">first-come, first-served basis</strong>. To maintain fairness and ensure the integrity of the registration process, <strong class="font-semibold">no proxy registrations are permitted under any circumstances</strong>. Students must register personally.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Addressing Full Class Situations:</strong> In the event that a particular class has reached its maximum capacity, students still have the option to register for that course by exploring and selecting a different available slot or an alternative venue where space is available.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Theory Embedded Lab (TEL) Courses - Complete Registration:</strong> For <strong class="font-semibold">Theory Embedded Lab (TEL)</strong> courses, it is imperative to understand that registration is deemed complete <strong class="font-semibold">only when both the theory component and all associated lab components are individually registered</strong>. If either the theory or any required lab component is not registered, the entire registration into that course will be considered incomplete. <strong class="font-semibold">Practical Tip:</strong> To avoid issues, upon completing registration for the theory part of a TEL course, proceed immediately to complete the registration for its corresponding lab(s) before moving on to other courses.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Re-registration of Failed Courses:</strong> Should you need to re-register for a previously failed course, you may do so if the same course is currently being offered. Confirmation of this re-registration is contingent upon your ability to register without any timetable clashes and is strictly subject to the timely payment of applicable re-registration fees.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Credit Range Recommendations:</strong> Students are strongly advised to register into courses recommended by their respective <strong class="font-semibold">Program School</strong>. The recommended credit range for a semester typically falls within a <strong class="font-semibold">minimum of 16 credits and a maximum of 27 credits</strong>. This range is suggested to optimize academic workload and is subject to the individual student's academic ability and personal interests.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Guidance for Open Elective Courses:</strong> For detailed information, guidance, and assistance related to registering for <strong class="font-semibold">Open Elective courses</strong>, please do not hesitate to contact your <strong class="font-semibold">Mentor, School Timetable Coordinator, Head of Department (HoD), or Head of Institution (HoI)</strong>. They are available to provide comprehensive support.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-5 pl-9 text-lg">
                <strong class="font-semibold">Final Timetable Confirmation:</strong> Upon the successful completion of the registration process for all your chosen courses (including both theory lectures and practical labs), this finalized schedule will officially serve as your <strong class="font-semibold">definitive timetable for the current semester</strong>.
